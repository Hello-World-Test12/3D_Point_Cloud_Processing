# Nearest Neighbors: Binary Search Tree, Kd-tree, Octree # 

There are mainly three parts in this chapter:
- Nearest Neighbor (NN) Search Problem 
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **Kd-tree (K-dimensional tree)**
- **Octree**

- K-NN Search 
- Fixed Radius-NN Search

## Kd-tree (K-dimensional tree) 
- Works for data of any dimension
